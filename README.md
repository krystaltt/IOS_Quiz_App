# Quiz App (IOS)

## About This App

This quiz app provides a fun and interactive way for users to test their knowledge through two types of questions: **Multiple Choice** and **Fill in the Blank**. The Multiple Choice questions are pre-made by the app, covering a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. In the Fill in the Blank mode, users can create their own questions within the app's settings, complete with the option to add images or drawings. For consistency, the answers in this mode are restricted to specific formats—numbers, commas, and dashes. All settings and customizations are automatically saved whenever the app is closed, ensuring that users can pick up right where they left off.

### Functionality: Multiple Choice

In the **Multiple Choice** section, users can answer pre-set questions from the system using an intuitive picker interface. This design ensures a smooth user experience by displaying a "Submit" button only after a selection is made, reducing the risk of accidentally submitting an answer without careful consideration. Additionally, a "Next" button in the top-right corner allows users to easily navigate through the remaining questions, offering flexibility in how they approach the quiz. Once an answer is submitted, the app immediately provides feedback on the screen, indicating whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect. This instant response helps users gauge their performance and learn in real-time.

### Functionality: Fill in the Blank

The **Fill in the Blank** section starts without any preset questions, allowing users to fully customize this mode by adding their own questions in the app's settings. Similar to the Multiple Choice section, a "Next" button is available in the top-right corner, enabling users to navigate through their custom questions with ease. To ensure consistency and clarity, the input field for answers is restricted to accept only numbers, commas, and dashes. This limitation is clearly communicated to users through placeholders in the text field, reminding them of the input format required for this section.

### Functionality: Settings for Adding Questions

In the **Settings** section, users have the flexibility to manage their custom questions by adding new ones, deleting existing ones, or rearranging their order. Each question can be enhanced with either a picture or a drawing, allowing for a more personalized quiz experience. When users choose to add a drawing, a white canvas appears, and they can start drawing with a black pen by default. To change the pen color, users can double-click on any blank area of the canvas, prompting a color selection menu to pop up. Alternatively, users can click directly on a drawn line to bring up options for color changes or deletion. If a user wishes to delete a specific line, they can click on it and select "Delete" from the options. For clearing the entire canvas, a long press on the screen will trigger a warning dialog, confirming whether the user really wants to erase all lines.

### Functionality: Score

The **Score** section provides an automatic tally of all questions answered across both the Multiple Choice and Fill in the Blank sections. Each time users view this section, it updates in real-time to reflect their current performance. The background color of the Score section changes dynamically based on the user's results: if there are more correct answers than incorrect ones, the background turns green; if there are more incorrect answers, it turns red. If the number of correct and incorrect answers is balanced, the background changes to yellow, providing immediate visual feedback on the user’s progress.

### Conclusion

With its customizable questions, dynamic scoring, and interactive features, this quiz app provides an engaging and personalized learning experience for users of all ages. Whether you're looking to challenge yourself with pre-set multiple-choice questions or create your own fill-in-the-blank quizzes, this app has something for everyone. Dive in, test your knowledge, and enjoy a fun, educational journey!
